We are an independent group of engineers from math /cs/ physcis background. Started this initiative as a way to reach out to like minded people for promoting independent research and learning which is a difficut proposition in Delhi NCR. Especially for enterprise audience based out of Delhi NCR there has not been a great platform for nurturing research work. We can know more about us through our [github team page ](https://github.com/orgs/HNought/teams/core).

We are mainly intersted in areas around AI/ML/Causality/Graphical Models, theory and applicaitons. But we donot intend to restrict ourselves to a closed domain but want to look at this group as platform for any applied /engineering problems ,from as diverse as linear dynamic systems to VC theory every thing is welcome.

If you are young researcher looking for guidance or veteran willing to mentor but cant find time to execute this is a great place to start. Interns can look for good opportunties for good research work.
